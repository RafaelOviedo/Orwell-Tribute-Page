              <h3 id=historyTitle>A little of the history of George Orwell next:</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
          He was the son of Richard Walmsley Blair, administrator of the opium ministry of the colonial 
          government of India, and Ida Mabel Limouzin, born in Burma, of French descent. His ancestor 
          Charles Blair owned hundreds of slaves in Jamaica.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          In 1909 he was sent to a small Anglican parochial school in Henley, which his older sister 
          had previously attended. He never wrote about his recollections of that time, but he must have
          impressed his teachers very favorably, for two years later he was recommended to the headmaster 
          of one of the most renowned preparatory schools in England at the time, St. Cyprian, at Eastbourne, Sussex.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          After completing his studies at Eton, he decided to join the Imperial Indian Police in Burma, 
          as he had no chance of getting a university scholarship and his family's means were not sufficient
          to pay for his education.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          After five years as an officer, he left the police force and returned to England in 1927 having 
          developed a hatred for imperialism that he shows in his first novel, Burmese Days, published in 1934,
           and in essays such as "A Hanging", 1931 or "Shooting an Elephant", 1936.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          In 1928 he moved to Paris, where his aunt Nellie lived, hoping to build his career as a man of letters. 
          After some unsuccessful attempts, Eric was forced to work as a dishwasher at the luxurious Hotel X, 
          as mentioned in his first book.
               </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          He adopted the pseudonym George Orwell in 1933
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          Orwell decided to fight in Spain with the idea of "killing fascists because someone must."
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          Upon returning to England, he was admitted to a sanatorium with tuberculosis, after which he went to Morocco to recover.
                <br />
          
          Orwell believed that while radical change was needed in Western societies, and thus in capitalist countries, 
          Stalinism posed a threat to the principles behind it.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          In 1941 he began working for the BBC's Eastern Service, primarily on programs to win the support of India and 
          East Asia for the Allied armies.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          Despite the good income, he resigned in 1943 to become a columnist and literary editor for the Tribune, 
          the left-leaning weekly magazine then run by Aneurin Bevan and Jon Kimche.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
          Orwell died in London at the age of forty-six from tuberculosis, a disease he had contracted 
          during the period he describes in "No white in Paris and London". He spent the last three years
          of his life between hospitals. Shortly before his death, he asked to be buried according to the Anglican rite. 
          He died on January 21, 1950. His remains rest in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire.
